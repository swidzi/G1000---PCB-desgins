# G1000 - PCB-desgins
PCB designes for G1000 Flight Sim controller STL (3d) files made by FlightSimMaker

This repository contains Eagle files for the PCB designed for G1000. All PCBs are millable on single sided clad with a 3018Pro CNC router.
Board design can be changed at anytime.
Boards are designed to be interconnected - if used separately they will probably not work.
